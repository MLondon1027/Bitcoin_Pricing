Question I am answering:

Can the price of bitcoin be predicted by the sentiment of related chatter on the internet and overall volume of trading?

Data Sources:
Google trends
Twitter (via API)
Coinmarketcap (for day closing pricing)


Models:
Linear regression for price prediction
Gradient Boost Regressor
Random Forest Classifier (to determine if the following day will end up or down += 5%)
